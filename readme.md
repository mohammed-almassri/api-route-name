# Api Route Name

give names to your api endpoints and easily get their url.

## Installation

`npm install api-route-name`

## Benefits

- not having to remember the full path to your api endpoints
- easily modify the url/arguments without changing a lot of code
- readability/data independence: your routes will be defined in their own file not in ajax calls

## Usage

declare an array of routes as so:

```javascript
const routes = [
  {
    prefix: '/api/v1',
    routes: [
      {
        name: 'auth',
        prefix: 'auth',
        resources: { signup: 'signup', login: 'login', user: 'user/:id' },
      },
      {
        name: 'users',
        prefix: 'users',
        resources: {
          get: ':id',
        },
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

import the class:

`const ApiRouteName = require('api-route-name').default;`
<br>
or
<br>
`import ApiRouteName from 'api-route-name`

initialize an `ApiRouteName` object with the route array you declared.

`const route = new ApiRouteName(routes)`

get your urls with the `get` method

```javascript
const signup = route.get('auth.signup');
//signup = "/api/v1/signup"
const user = route.get('user', { id: 10 });
//user =  "/api/v1/user/10"
```

## Urls and Names

the `prefix` attribute specifies a prefix for all the routes in the `routes` array and it's children.

any object with a `prefix` should have a `name` attribute but it's not required.

every `routes` can have a nested `routes`, in that case it should have a `prefix` and a `name`.

to specify the bottom-level routes you need to declare a `resources` object inside one of the objects in a `routes` array

a route in a route object like

```javascript
[{
    prefix: "prefix1",
    name: "name1"
    routes: [{
        prefix: "prefix2",
        name: "name2"
        routes: [{
            prefix: "prefix3",
            name: "name3"
            resources: {
                routeName: "routeURL"
            }
        }]
    }]
}]
```

will have the name `name1.name2.name3.routeName` and a path of `prefix1/prefix2/prefix3/routeURL`

the name of the resource is taken from the attribute name.

## Arguments

api-route-name uses the [url-pattern](https://www.npmjs.com/package/url-pattern) library for it's pattern matching so consider reading it's docs.

you can add arguments to your urls by adding a colon ":" before the argument name. for example you want to get the posts for a specific user you would do the following:

```javascript
{
...
userPosts:"users/:id/posts"
}
```

then to retrieve the posts for user with id 21 you pass an object with attributes matching your arguments.

```javascript
const posts = route.get('userPost', { id: 21 });
//posts =  "{prefix you specified}/user/21/posts"
```

you can add multiple arguments `blogsByDate : "users/:name/blogposts/:date"`

and get the url with `routeNames(routes,'blogsByDate',{name:"John Doe",date:"2019-1-2"})`

## Recommended Usage

I recommend putting your routes in a separate module, creating a function that returns the value
from calling `routeNames` with your `routes` object and exporting that function as default.

```javascript
//filename: api-routes.js
import ApiRouteName from 'api-route-name';

const routes = [
  {
    //specify your routes here
  },
];

export default new ApiRouteName(routes);
```

then use it in anywhere in your app

```javascript
//other file
import route from './api-routes';
route.get('posts.create'),
```
